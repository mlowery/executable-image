# it is expected that the caller will pass in --entrypoint and an image name followed by any additional arguments

# args explained:
# -w:                make relative paths work
# --volume (/tmp/):  make /tmp/... paths work; see [1]
# --volume ($HOME/): make ~/... paths work
# --net:             no need for separate net namespace
# --rm:              no need to keep this container

# [1] Docker for Mac automatically configures File Sharing for /tmp but $TMPDIR looks like 
#     /var/folders/3y/d44gn_2x7vv8d9d67969f54c0000gn/T/ which is not configured in File Sharing;
#     the workaround is to use /tmp instead of $TMPDIR; if you pass paths that use $TMPDIR, they 
#     will not work; instead, /tmp instead; example: mktemp --tmpdir=/tmp
